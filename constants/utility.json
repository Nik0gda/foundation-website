  "why": " Most of the launchpads use a tier system in order to have access to the IGO. You need to stake the platform’s token in order to get in one of the tiers. Launchpads usually require you to buy at least $5,000–$15,000 to get the first tiers. 90% of the people are in the first tiers that don’t guarantee a place in the IGO, only a chance in the raffle. As a result only big players are able to consistently participate and buy tokens/coins at the best price possible.",
  "solution": "  Every NFT will have the same power, but different hand drawn art. You will be able to stake your NFT to get rewarded with a $FNDT token which is used for entering into IGOs / IDO’s. In order to participate in any IGO you will need to burn x amount of $FNDT. In real time you will see how many people applied to each IGO and the max amount of USD each wallet can contribute to the IGO. This way you’ll be able to analyze in real time if it’s worth entering the project or not and make it fair for all the project holders."
