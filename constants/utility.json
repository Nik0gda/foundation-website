  "why": "  Most of the launchpads use a tier system to give an opportunity to invest in projects. You need to stake the platform’s token to get in one of the tiers. Launchpads usually require you to buy at least $5,000–$15,000 to get into initial tiers. That being said, 90% of the retail investors are in the first tiers that don’t guarantee a place in the IGO/IDO/ICO, only a chance in the raffle. As a result, only big players can consistently participate and buy tokens/coins at the best price possible.",
  "solution": "  Foundation NFT will grant you access to an exclusive community that has a reserved place in any project that the community votes for/agrees on to participate in. This will be done by getting the highest tiers on launchpads using the proceeds from the NFT minting phase. Furthermore, every NFT holder will get a chance to participate/allocate funds for projects they love."
