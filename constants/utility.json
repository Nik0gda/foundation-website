  "why": " Most of the launchpads use a tier system in order to have access to the IGO. You need to stake the platform’s token in order to get in one of the tiers. Launchpads usually require you to buy at least $5,000–$15,000 to get the first tiers. 90% of the retail investors are in the first tiers that don’t guarantee a place in the IGO, only a chance in the raffle. As a result only big players are able to consistently participate and buy tokens/coins at the best price possible.",
  "solution": "  Foundation NFT will grant you access to an exclusive community that has a reserved place in any IGO that the community votes for/agrees on to participate in. This will be done by getting the highest tiers on launchpads using the proceeds from the NFT minting phase. Furthermore every NFT holder will get a chance to participate / allocate funds for projects the love."
